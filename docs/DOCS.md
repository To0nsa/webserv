# Documentation

This directory contains the generated project documentation.

## Structure

- `html/` â€” The HTML output generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).
  - Main entry point: [`index.html`](html/index.html)

## How to regenerate documentation

If you modify or add code comments, you can regenerate the documentation locally:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

This will update the `html/` folder automatically.

## GitHub Pages

The contents of `docs/html/` are published automatically via GitHub Pages.

The documentation is automatically regenerated and deployed whenever a `git push` is made to the `main` branch.

You can view the live documentation at:

**[https://to0nsa.github.io/webserv/](https://to0nsa.github.io/webserv/)**

## Notes

- The documentation is generated from `include/`, `src/`, and `tests/` directories.
- Graphs (call graphs, caller graphs) are included if [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/) is installed.
