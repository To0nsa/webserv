# Webserv Project - Action Plan

___

## SPRINT 1 - minimal non-blocking HTTP server

<details>
<summary><strong>See Sprint 1</strong></summary>

## Sprint Goal

Build a **minimal non-blocking HTTP server** that:

- Accepts incoming client connections (non-blocking).
- Parses a basic HTTP request line (GET / HTTP/1.1).
- Sends a **hardcoded 200 OK** "Hello World" HTTP response.
- Uses a **single `poll()` loop** for all socket operations.
- Compiles cleanly using the **Makefile**.

___

## Developer Assignments

### Dev 1 - Networking

- Create `SocketManager`:
  - Bind a TCP socket to port 8080.
  - Set socket to non-blocking mode (O_NONBLOCK).
- Create `PollManager`:
  - Handle the `poll()` loop for all FDs.
  - Accept new clients when the server socket has a POLLIN event.
  - Set new client sockets to non-blocking.

**Output**: Accept clients without blocking.

### Dev 2 - HTTP Parsing + Response

- Create `HttpRequestParser`:
  - Parse the first request line (method, path, HTTP version).
- Create `HttpResponseBuilder`:
  - Always send a hardcoded 200 OK response:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 13

Hello, world!
```

**Output**: Clients receive "Hello World" on any request.

### Dev 3 - Configuration Management

- Create `Config` class:
  - Hardcode default settings (port 8080).
  - No real `.conf` file parsing yet.
- Validate that the **Makefile** builds correctly.
- Create a minimal `main.cpp`:
  - Instantiate `SocketManager`, `PollManager`.
  - Start server loop.

**Output**: Server starts and runs correctly.

___

___

## Priorities

| Priority | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| ðŸ”´ P0 | Networking (poll, non-blocking accept) |
| ðŸ”´ P0 | HTTP parsing and 200 OK response |
| ðŸ”´ P0 | Config skeleton and clean project start |

___

## Final Deliverable

> A **working non-blocking HTTP server** that accepts multiple connections and replies "Hello World".

___

## Mindset Reminder

> Focus ONLY on Sprint 1 scope.
> No CGI, no POST, no DELETE, no sessions yet.

First get a **rock-solid event loop** with basic GET handling.

## SPRINT 2 - Configuration & Dynamic Serving

<details>
<summary><strong>See Sprint 2</strong></summary>

## Sprint 2 Goal

Extend the server to:

- Parse real `.conf` configuration files.
- Support multiple servers and ports.
- Serve static files based on routing rules.
- Display error pages when appropriate.

Make the server dynamic and compliant with HTTP hosting needs.

___

## Developer Assignments (sprint 2)

### Dev 3 - Configuration Parser

- Parse `.conf` files inspired by Nginx syntax.
- Support multiple `server` blocks with:
  - Listen ports.
  - Server names.
  - Roots.
  - Error pages.
  - Upload paths.
  - Accepted methods.
- Map configuration into in-memory structures.

**Output**: Server config fully loaded before boot.

### Dev 2 - Extended HTTP Parsing and Responses

- Extend `HttpRequestParser` to parse full headers.
- Improve `HttpResponseBuilder`:
  - Serve real files from configured `root`.
  - Send 404 error page if file not found.
- Start handling simple `POST` (accepting upload body).

**Output**: Server responds with real file contents or proper errors.

### Dev 1 - PollManager and Routing Enhancements

- Manage multiple server sockets if different ports are needed.
- Extend `PollManager`:
  - Accept connections on multiple FDs.
  - Match incoming connections to the correct server config using Host header.

**Output**: Correct server config selected per request.

___

## Mindset Reminder (sprint 2)

> Configuration-driven design is the key for Sprint 2.
>
> No hardcoded routes anymore: everything must come from the `.conf` file.

Prepare the foundation for CGI, Uploads, Sessions, and Bonus work later!

**Output**: Server processes all major HTTP methods correctly.

#### Dev 1 - CGI Integration

- Implement CGI execution:
  - Fork for CGI requests only.
  - Setup environment variables (PATH_INFO, QUERY_STRING, etc.).
  - Pass request body to CGI via stdin.

- Implement error handling:
  - Serve 400 (Bad Request), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found), 413 (Payload Too Large), 500 (Server Error) pages.

**Output**: Server configurable for routes, methods, uploads, error pages.

___

### Mindset Reminder (sprint 3)

> This sprint finishes all **mandatory** work.
>
> Bonuses (cookies, sessions, WebSocket) **only** happen after Sprint 3 total success.

Ensure that everything works **cleanly, reliably, and resiliently**.

</details>

___

## SPRINT 4 - Cookies and Sessions

<details>
<summary><strong>See Sprint 4</strong></summary>

> Bonus sprint: Implement **stateful client sessions** via **HTTP Cookies**.

This feature increases server functionality for real-world usage and adds significant value to the defense bonus points.

___

### Developer Assignments (sprint 4)

#### Dev 2 - Cookie Parsing and Handling

- Parse `Cookie:` header from incoming requests.
- Extract session ID if present.
- Handle missing/invalid cookies cleanly (assign new session).

#### Dev 3 - Session Management

- Implement an in-memory session store (map of session IDs -> session data).
- Create and track sessions with expiration or timeout policy.
- Provide methods to create, retrieve, and delete sessions.

#### Dev 1 - Response Cookies

- Extend `HttpResponseBuilder` to:
  - Add `Set-Cookie:` headers when a new session is created.
  - Optionally refresh cookie expiration for active sessions.

___

### Tasks Summary (sprint 4)

| Task | Owner | Priority | Size |
|:-----|:------|:---------|:-----|
| Parse incoming `Cookie:` headers | Dev 2 | P2 | M |
| Store/retrieve session data server-side | Dev 3 | P2 | M |
| Generate secure session IDs | Dev 3 | P2 | S |
| Send `Set-Cookie:` headers in responses | Dev 1 | P2 | M |
| Handle session expiration/timeout | Dev 3 | P2 | S |
| Add session integration to dynamic routes | Shared | P2 | M |

___

### Sprint 4 Success Criteria

- New clients receive a `Set-Cookie: session_id=<value>` header.
- Returning clients send valid `Cookie:` and retrieve same session.
- Sessions can store temporary data (e.g., user preferences, small payloads).
- Sessions expire after timeout or inactivity.

___

### Key Deliverables (sprint 4)

- Stateless HTTP session management over cookies.
- Server-side session memory storage.
- Proper cookie setting and parsing.
- Secure session ID generation (randomized).

___

### Constraints and Reminders

- Session IDs must be **reasonably secure** (random, non-predictable).
- Session expiration handling should avoid memory leaks (cleanup expired sessions).
- Keep session storage lightweight (simple in-memory map is sufficient for Webserv).

___

### Mindset Reminder (sprint 4)

> Focus on **clean, modular session management**.
>
> Keep it minimal but solid: no databases, no file-based session persistence needed.

}
```

#### Dev 2 - Request Detection

- Update `HttpRequestParser` or `RequestHandler`:
  - Detect when the requested file matches a CGI extension.
  - Select the correct interpreter.

#### Dev 1 - CGI Launcher Update

- Modify CGI execution:
  - Use the appropriate interpreter path based on the file extension.
  - Not hardcoded to only one interpreter.

___

### Constraints and Reminders (sprint 5)

- Avoid hardcoding assumptions about interpreters.
- Properly handle fork/exec errors (send 500 Internal Server Error).

__

### Mindset Reminder (sprint 5)

> Make your server **adaptable and flexible** to any scripting backend.
>
> This bonus makes your server feel "real" like NGINX or Apache.
